A Log Book by JT is a compiled personal notes which revolved and written by me, Jason Tanuwijaya.

This site might in addtion stores my thought process, personal journal, idea about work and showcases my previous work.

## Who are you?
Hello, visitor! Welcome to my humble site.

My name is Jason Tanuwijaya, usually called JT are jay.


In case you're wondering how old I am, I born in the year of Fire Rat :fire::mouse:. Do the research, padawan.

### What is your background?
- Born into South East Asian family.
- Hailing from [City of Heros, Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surabaya)
- Currently stays in [the most expensive city in the world, Singapore](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jwebb/2017/11/30/singapore-is-still-the-most-expensive-city-in-the-world/#79ab6e48c5e9)

#### What did you study last time?
I completed my Bachelor of Science (B.Sc (Hons)) in Nanyang Technological University (NTU) of [pure physics along with a second major in mathemtics/statistics](http://spms.ntu.edu.sg/PhysicsandAppliedPhysics/Undergraduates/Pages/Curriculum/Undergrad2ndMajorAY13_14.aspx) with Honours (Distinction).

<!-- My subject interest during my undergraduate year is  -->

Yet, the courses load was not meant for the faint hearted. On my intake batch, **the number of Academic Unit (AU) was clocked at 176** (compare that to the average single major in NTU which approximately require 132-138 AU).

Personally, it is challenging to complete such extra amount of courses in the 4 years. Yet, I think it worths the extra effort if you are actually have a strong interest in both science subject. For you who are interested in the courses, the good news is that they have reduced the number of course required for graduation (this is not sponsored).

Prior my university education, I completed my senior high school/junior college in my hometown and took Science stream.
